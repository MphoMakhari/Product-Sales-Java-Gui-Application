# Product-Sales-Java-Gui-Application


application to manage information of products that are sold 
per item (item- based products) as well as products that are sold by weight 
(weight-based products). Each product has a barcode of 12 digits. Products that 
are sold per item have a name, manufacturer, and unit price (in cents). Products 
that are sold by weight have a name, unit price (in cents per kilogram) as well 
as a weight (in grams).
Each type of product also needs a method (calculateTotalCost ()) to calculate 
its total cost. For item- based products the total cost is the unit price plus tax. 
The total cost of a weight-based product is the productâ€™s weight multiplied with 
its unit price plus tax. Use 15% as the tax rate for both types of products.

Two concrete classes 
(ItemBasedProduct and WeightBasedProduct) and one abstract class 
Product should be among the identified classes. Produce code of all the 
identified classes.
